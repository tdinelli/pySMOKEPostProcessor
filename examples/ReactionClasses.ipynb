    "> * `Class type`: defined by the user in **rxn_class_groups.txt** text file (see data/Classes). Broad classification (e.g., bond-fission, H-abstraction, growth)\n",
    "> * `Reaction type`: reaction channels belonging to a certain class type. These are listed within the class types in the text file. They must also be present in the **kinetics.xml** file (hard coded)\n",
    "> * `Species type`: type of species that defines the functional group participating to the reaction (e.g., A1-M is the aromatic ring in its molecular form, A1-R is a phenyl-like radical)\n",
    "> * `Bimolecular type`: classification according to unimolecular/bimolecular reaction type, accounting for the nature of the reacting species (M, R, RSR: molecule, radical, resonance-stabilized radical). This classification does not require specific input.\n"
